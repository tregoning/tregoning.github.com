        <p>Facebook will be releasing their new <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/793/Introducing-Paper-Stories-from-Facebook">Paper</a> app in a few days. After watching their <a href="https://vimeo.com/85421325">preview video</a> I was struck by the new gestures/UX it introduced.</p>

        <img class="tile" src="http://s3.jt.io/tilt.gif" alt="Facebook's Paper app in action" />

        <p>While watching the video, I was thinking how I could replicate some of its features using plain HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
        <p>I decided to start with the photo tilt feature, it turned out to be relatively simple to implement (at least based on what I have seen in the video)</p>
        <p>I just pushed to Github a tool/hack called <a href="https://github.com/tregoning/photoTilt">PhotoTilt</a> which, given a photo and a container, will replicate Paper's tilt functionality.</p>
        <p>One advantage that native currently has over the mobile web is that there is no way to stop the device from changing orientation (portrait/landscape) when tilting too much.
            There is an experimental feature: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen.lockOrientation">Screen.lockOrientation</a> but currently only works in Firefox for web pages that are in full-screen mode.</p>
        <p>Finally, here is a working <a href="http://s3.jt.io/tilt/index.html">demo</a>. Make sure you test this on a device with a triaxial/accelerometer, like a phone/tablet, with orientation locked in portrait mode.</p>

            <h1><a href="/2013/map-comparison/">Performance Comparison of Web Map Services</a></h1>
            <time datetime="2013-11-08" pubdate>November 08, 2013</time>

        <p>
            I have been working on a little side project in my spare time that uses maps. I was appalled at the performance of my web app on mobile (specially when using cell data).
            I did a little digging and I found that most of the lag was not coming from my app, instead it was coming from Google Maps which, in my Nexus phone, was loading over 1MB of images,
            4 custom web fonts and making a whopping total of 47 HTTP calls.
        </p>

        <p>
            Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Google maps but for such a key/mainstream product I find it surprisingly heavy. I decided to look into different map providers, do a bit of measuring and
            see how well other providers stack against Google Maps.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the interest of fairness, it should be noted that the feature set between these providers is not the same. However, I tested/measured for what I believe to be the most common map use-case:
            Displaying a map around my location and highlighting stuff with pins drops/markers.
        </p>

        <p>
            These are the different providers (and actual pages) that I used for the test. All these maps look and feel the same:
        </p>

        <ul class="side-list">
            <li><a href="http://s3.jt.io/maps/google.html" target="Google">Google</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://s3.jt.io/maps/nokia.html" target="Nokia">Nokia</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://s3.jt.io/maps/bing.html" target="Bing">Bing</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://s3.jt.io/maps/mapbox.html" target="Mapbox">Mapbox</a></li>
        </ul>


        <p>
            Note: The chart data does not include or take into account the page where I loaded the map from. (i.e. the chart data is purely the map data)
        </p>

        <div id="dataTransferChart"></div>
        <div id="httpConnectionsChart"></div>
        <div id="duration"></div>

        <p>
            Based on these numbers, I plan to refactor my app to use Mapbox instead of Google Maps as, at least for now, it outperforms the latter significantly.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally If you want to see some raw numbers, I have published <a href="http://bit.ly/map-stats">this</a> spreadsheet,
            I have also made the source of the different map pages used for this test available in Github <a href="https://github.com/tregoning/map-comparison/tree/master">here</a>.

		<p>I didn't know that YouTube's logo was inspired by the Caltrain logo. It is remarkable how similar both logos are, especially when comparing them side by side.</p>

			<h1><a href="/2013/git-pre-commit-js-lint-script/">Javascript Lint Pre-commit Script</a></h1>
			<time datetime="2013-03-10" pubdate>March 10, 2013</time>
		</header>

		<p>
			I've created a GIT pre-commit script called <a href="https://github.com/tregoning/Sgt-Donowitz">"Sgt Donowitz"</a> (named after the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3837954304/ch0101641">character</a> in the movie Inglorious Bastards). The script enforces Javascript code quality and consistency by using <a href="http://jshint.com">JSHint</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The script runs all new or modified Javascript files against JSHint for every commit; if it finds any issues it simply aborts the commit.
		</p>

		<small><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pasukaru76/5721986136">Photo by pasukaru76</a></small>

		<p>You can configure what rules you want to enforce/ignore by using the config file <a href="https://github.com/tregoning/Sgt-Donowitz/blob/master/.jshintrc">".jshintrc"</a> (see <a href="http://www.jshint.com/docs/#enforcing_options">here</a> for all the available options).</p>

		<p>You can also set rules to ignore any file or directory (e.g. 3rd party libraries) by using ".jshintignore" (it works similarly to <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html">".gitignore"</a> files).</p>

		<p>Nowadays you can integrate JS Linting <a href="http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2012/05/lint-your-javascript-with-jslintjshint-in-real-time/">into</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://fgnass.posterous.com/jslint-in-textmate">most</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/uipoet/sublime-jshint">IDEs</a>. Whilst this is true, there is nothing stoping you from committing code that doesn't pass JS Linting. That's where <a href="https://github.com/tregoning/Sgt-Donowitz">Sgt Donowitz</a> comes in: it ensures code goodness remains high at all times by blocking bad/rushed code from being commited.</p>

		<p>In a nutshell, <a href="https://github.com/tregoning/Sgt-Donowitz">Sgt Donowitz</a> will force you to keep your JS code quality high and consistent. To setup the pre-commit script, simply run the following command from your project's root:
		</p>

		<pre>curl -s jt.io/lint | sh</pre>

		<p>
			The source code is published on <a href="https://github.com/tregoning/Sgt-Donowitz">Github</a> feel free to tweak it, create an <a href="https://github.com/tregoning/Sgt-Donowitz/issues">issue</a> or leave a <a href="/2013/git-pre-commit-js-lint-script/#disqus_thread">comment</a>... In the meantime: "The beatings will continue until morale improves".
